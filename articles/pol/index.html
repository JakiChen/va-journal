		<p>The post-war cultural liberalisation which arose in Europe and America throughout the 1950s–&gt;60s resulted in a media revolution. As the new television age dawned, magazines also evolved to reflect the shifting societal attitudes towards the arts, politics, gender and entertainment. <em>TWEN</em> and <em>NOVA</em> were two of the most influential periodicals to emerge in this transformative period, profoundly impacting on editorial design across the globe. By the late1960s, Australian magazine publishing was ready for its own revolution.

<p>
	Gareth Powell, a controversial Welsh-born publisher, arrived in Australia in 1967 to ‘a modicum of unfavourable publicity in the Australian press’ <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>. His scandalous reputation resulted largely from the publishing of <em>Fanny Hill</em> by Mayflower Books in 1963. The bawdy 1748 novel is considered the first original English prose pornography, and, as publisher, the
	ensuing kerfuffle landed Powell in jail for gross indecency. Publicity surrounding the incident and resultant high profile court case helped change staid British laws relating to sexual content. Powell was cast as a provocateur, a role he would come to embrace throughout his career. 
</p>

</figure>
<p>Powell was just 37 when he emigrated to Sydney, confident his larrikin persona would be better
	appreciated in his adopted country. Having established a new publishing venture under the name
	‘Gareth Powell and Associates’, his first title
	was a raging success. <em>Now you’ll think I’m awful</em> was subtitled ‘That Outrageous Book about
	Sex and the Australian Girl’. A frank exposé by journalist Sue Rhodes, the book was a bestseller for
	Powell’s new imprint. 
</p>
<p>Shifting his focus to magazines, he initiated a number of new titles including <em>Surf</em>, which
	was aimed at the growing youth market, and (in association with Jack de Lissa) <em>Chance</em>.
	Inspired by <em>Penthouse</em> and <em>Playboy</em> and deliberately provocative, <em>Chance</em>
	soon became mired in court battles, most famously in a landmark case when issues were seized by
	Australian customs on arrival from Powell’s Hong Kong printers. The publisher recalled having
	the idea for his next magazine whilst sitting in court awaiting a verdict. ‘I had the idea for doing
	a women’s magazine as <em>Chance</em> was knocked on the head by a judge. I knew the kind of
	magazine I wanted’. <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> 
</p>

</figure>
<p>
	<em>POL</em> was an attempt to capture the radical spirit of the 1960s, packaged in a sophisticated,
	original format. Shocked at the poor standard of local printing, Powell created a benchmark magazine
	with high quality production values
	and an emphasis on bold editorial design. <em>POL</em> was the first major Australian women’s
	magazine to use colour offset printing, and the first to have its issues printed overseas; this was
	done by the Hong Kong branch of Dai Nippon
	Printing before issues were air-freighted to Australia. ‘We ditched hot lead typesetting from the
	beginning … the headings in those days were all Letraset. But I was totally shocked at what was
	accepted in Australia. Rubbish printing
	on rubbish paper’. <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>A pivotal initial decision was the appointment <em>POL</em>&#8217;s first editor. Based on a
	recommendation from Jack De Lissa, he approached Richard Walsh, a kindred spirit with his own
	controversial background as one of <em>OZ</em> magazine’s
	founders. <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> Walsh proved an astute
	choice, and contributed significantly to the new magazine’s success. The combination of
	Powell&#8217;s entrepreneurial flair and Walsh&#8217;s
	publishing instincts proved fertile. Of Walsh, Powell said &#8216;Clearly he was an editorial
	genius. With Richard you merely lit the touch paper and stood well back&#8217;. <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> </p>
<p>Powell also recognised that developing a distinctive editorial visual identity would be essential. In
	Graeme (Gus) Cohen he found an art director inspired by <em>TWEN</em> and <em>NOVA</em>, two of the
	most important magazines of the 20th
	Century. <em>TWEN</em> (1959–1970) was a men’s magazine with a bold aesthetic honed by the legendary
	German art director Willy Fleckhaus (Max Bill was the magazine&#8217;s inaugural art director).
	Fleckhaus pioneered a simple approach
	where large, impactful photography was juxtaposed with blocks of typographic content. The effect was
	visually dramatic, and <em>TWEN</em>&#8217;s editorial vocabulary was mimicked by countless admiring
	art directors. As <em>TWEN</em>&#8217;s
	notoriety grew, so did Fleckhaus&#8217;s power, and he effectively became the magazine&#8217;s
	second editor. He would occasionally invite visiting colleagues to assume his role while on holiday,
	including the London-based photographer
	and designer Harry Peccinnoti. <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup>

<p>
	British magazine <em>NOVA</em> (1965–75) was created as a revolutionary women’s journal, ‘the new
	kind of magazine for a new kind of woman’. Like <em>TWEN</em>, it relied on ground-breaking
	editorial design, driven initially by Peccinnoti
	and then from 1969–1975, David Hillman. <em>NOVA</em> captured the spirit of London&#8217;s
	&#8216;Swinging Sixties,&#8217; embodying a time of unrivalled creativity and sexual and artistic
	revolution. Reflecting upon the early issues
	of <em>POL</em>, the impact of <em>NOVA</em> is palpable, a reference point Cohen is happy to admit
	to: ‘We were very aware of <em>NOVA</em>, and were influenced by what it did’.

</figure>
<p>
	The pages of <em>TWEN</em> and <em>NOVA</em> featured the work of many great lensmen (and women). In
	Australia, as the sixties came to a close, a new wave of young photographers were seeking a platform
	to show their wares. Over time, Grant
	Medford, Graham McCarter, Wesley Stacey, Anthony Crowell, Douglas Holleley, Colin Beard, Lewis
	Morley, Greg Weight, Greg Barrett, Jacqueline Mitelman, Robin Stacey, Brett Hilder, Dieter Muller
	and Rennie Ellis all appeared on <em>POL</em>’s
	pages.
</p>
<p>A lack of resources and tight budgets left much to the photographer’s initiative, but the open briefs
	provided almost total creative freedom. The resultant images were often experimental and
	progressive, and <em>POL</em>’s body of work, particularly within the field of fashion photography, is perhaps its most telling creative legacy.
</p>
<p>With Gough Whitlam and his Labour Party on the rise in the early 70s, <em>POL</em>’s heady mix of
	edgy fashion photography, informative and challenging features and high production values aligned
	perfectly with the shifting sands of Australian culture. A roster of guest editors included some of the era’s most influential cultural figures
	including Germaine Greer (1972), Richard Neville (1974) and Don Dustan (1980).

<p>
	Though Powell sold off his interests in POL in the early 1970s, the magazine continued until 1986. By
	the 1980s the women’s magazine market was overflowing with competitors, many heavily influenced by
	<em>POL</em>’s ground-breaking approach.
	Regular appearances in award annuals from this era indicate the level of respect <em>POL</em>
	retained from the design industry. 
</p>
<p>
	Powell’s charismatic energy drove the success of the imprint during the heady early days, and issues
	from that time reflect Australia’s emerging confidence in a period of extraordinary political and
	social change. The magazine’s aspirational
	disposition is evident in this quote from Don Dustan: ‘<em>Pol</em> delights in excellence,
	individuality, creativity and zest for life. We chronicle Australia’s maturity. We pursue the causes
	of the good. Australians of the world
	unite and read <em>POL</em> – you have nothing to lose but your cultural cringe’.<sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup>
